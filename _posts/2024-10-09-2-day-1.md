## Introduction

I am back after finally getting a website to post on [and after trying and switching from at least 3 themes due to various reasons]. Anyways, thanks to Hyde, we shall now focus on day one's [our day two] challenge.

> Wonder why the very first day of this challenge comes after the fourth day? It's because I'm following up from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). I assure you that from hereon, the challenge will be in the usual order [barring the 4th day, of course].

### Anyways, let's get buildin'

Tech used : JS DOM

Today we're building a drum-kit. The cover image of this post shows one as an example in case you don't know what a drum-kit is.

Our drum-kit site will do the following things when you press one of the displayed keys :

- Plays the sound associated with the key you press.
- Makes the displayed key bigger [i.e. it pops up with a jig] and applies a border around it.

#### HTML

We'll use the boilerplate provided by VSCODE by pressing `!` and hitting enter. Then we attach the stylesheet and external JS.

After that, we're creating a `<div>` with a set of `<div>` nested inside it.

#### CSS

> Makes the displayed key bigger [i.e. it pops up with a jig] and applies a border around it.

This effect can be done using a CSS class. JS DOM will add this class to the key the moment the key is pressed. Here we can define border stuff, box-shadows, etc.

The key has a class as well. It has this transition style which enables this animation.
